const p = 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?';
console.log(p.replace('dog', 'monkey'));
// expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy monkey. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"

const regex = /Dog/i;

// expected output: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy ferret. If the dog reacted, was it really lazy?"

// replace 只替换第一个匹配项！

// replaceAll 可以替换所有匹配项，但是 IE 不兼容！
